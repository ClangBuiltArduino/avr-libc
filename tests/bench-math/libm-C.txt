1For devices wihout MUL instruction the following applies:
1- The execution times for multiplication and for the transcendental functions
1  are roughly twice the time for devices that have MUL.
1- The execution times for the remaining functions are roughly the same.
1- The maximal relative errors are the same, i.e. independent of MUL.
